# Online Banking System README

Title: Online Banking System
Problem Statement:
Many individuals and businesses encounter challenges with traditional banking processes, such as long queues and limited access to real-time financial information. Simplifying these processes through an online banking system can offer secure, convenient access to managing accounts, monitoring transactions, and performing financial operations from anywhere.

Project Idea:
Develop an online banking system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application will focus on providing robust user authentication, efficient account management, seamless transaction tracking, and enhanced financial management capabilities.

Project Components:
Account Management:

Provide users with an intuitive dashboard displaying their bank account overview, including balances, account numbers, and types (e.g., savings, checking).
Enable detailed transaction history views for each account, showcasing deposits, withdrawals, and transfers for comprehensive financial tracking.
Money Transfer and Payments:

Facilitate secure money transfers between users' accounts or to other users' accounts within the system.
Implement payment functionalities to support bill payments and other financial transactions seamlessly.
Account Statements:

Generate downloadable account statements in PDF format, allowing users to review and archive their financial activities over specific periods.
Provide a clear breakdown of transactions, ensuring transparency and ease of financial record-keeping.
Transaction Categorization and Insights:

Automatically categorize transactions (e.g., groceries, entertainment) to provide users with insights into their spending habits.
Utilize charts and graphs to visually represent spending patterns and trends, helping users analyze their financial behaviors over time.
